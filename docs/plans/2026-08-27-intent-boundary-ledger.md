# Intent-boundary slice — execution ledger

Rulings are written at task boundaries, never rewritten after the fact.

## Rulings

1. **R1 — the certified engine is standing authority.** Atoms remote
   `main` `038513f` is the binding engine contract (cut 11 §2: no atoms
   change ships with this slice); no task edits atoms.
2. **R2 — host recertification is a separate prerequisite.** The Linux
   7.1.9 ext4 tuple was certified and merged into the local Atoms `main`
   at `77a89e2` before this slice began. It changes no engine behavior and
   no Atoms change ships with this Science slice.

## Heads
