"""The opt-in that lets CI report a missing capability instead of failing.

The conversion itself is exercised by every capability-dependent test on a
runner; what is easy to get wrong, and cheap to pin here, is the gate in front
of it. Anything but an explicit "1" must leave the suite closed, because a
half-set variable disarming the gate is the failure nobody would notice.
