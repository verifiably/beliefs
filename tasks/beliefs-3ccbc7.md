Piece of ops ops-4b96bf. Add `set quiet` beside the other settings at the top of the justfile so just no longer echoes recipe lines (`just --verbose` still shows them). Nothing else: `tasks check` itself prints nothing on a clean tree since tasks-9af90a. A clean commit then prints nothing; failures are unchanged.
