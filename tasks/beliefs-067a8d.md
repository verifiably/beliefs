Adopt the approved shared test execution policy for this personal project after the ops pilot. Owner: the next beliefs implementer; Keith approves external activation. State: pending preparation, not offloaded. Shared authority: ops-8bfa85 (read its approved spec and plan with tasks doc); pilot prerequisite ops-68729d.

Observed 2026-10-29: code checkout is its own Git top level; records kind in-tree; profile personal. Current policy file: absent (enabled). Wrapper: {"tools/tt": "# tt version 7"}. Commands: test-fast, test-one, test, check, setup, hook-pre-commit, hook-pre-push, ci-python. Read [ref:front-door] for actual commands and setup. Workflows: .github/workflows/ci.yml.

Current command/ref declarations:
```
py_test_cmd := py_fast_cmd + " && (cd python && uv run --frozen pytest tests/test_n2.py)"
ts_test_cmd := "(cd ts && npm test)"
fast_cmd := py_fast_cmd + " && " + ts_fast_cmd
test_cmd := py_test_cmd + " && " + ts_test_cmd
one_cmd := "cd python && uv run --frozen pytest"
ci_suite_refs := "refs/heads/main"
ci_remote := "origin"
```

Prepare a reviewed project-specific design/plan and isolated worktree. Adopt the published wrapper only after ops and obs readers are live. Keep test-one/focused implementation checks and mandatory hygiene on; split broad lint/type/test work into explicit targets. Preserve current selectors and argument forwarding. Add the forced test-full route. Verify branch/ref coverage against workflow triggers and use explicit TT_FORCE=1 for the full remote suite, including nested recipes. One suite per push, latest-ref cancellation, no duplicate internal-PR run. Keep local policy enabled until an approved hosted invocation finishes with a nonzero test count and accepted coverage.

Inventory capability omissions and private sibling checkouts from actual workflow/setup; none are presumed equivalent to local verification. The current workflow sets VERIFIABLY_UNCERTIFIED_HOST=1; explicitly count certified-volume omissions. Preserve existing Python matrix and Python/TypeScript jobs and atoms/nodes sibling checkouts.

Prepare the activation packet with current private-repository allowance and enforced no-paid-overage setting, setup, exact refs, executed tests, excluded modules and skipped-test/module counts. Publishing workflows, live global instruction/hook delivery and account changes require explicit approval. Existing work/external/shared Git roots are not independent opt-ins. Reuse host/profile proof only for identical setup paths. Detached records remain separate from code policy lookup.

After approved activation, commit .tt.toml with real broad target names, verify focused execution/recorded skip/forced failure/covered remote push, and retire each disabled timing obligation explicitly without claiming performance verification. Record the actual activation revision/time here. On hook-split integration and rollback write exactly: policy: enabled at <RFC3339-UTC> revision <full-sha>. This record's source tt-policy:beliefs is the latency floor lookup key. Keep remaining diagnosis and unrelated obligations. Report status to ops-39bff6; never label pending work as offloaded. The first actual activation files the 30-day regret review under ops; no scheduler and no invented date.
